### Instructions:

1. The game is played by **two players**. One of the players must create a **room-id** and share it with the other player. The other player should use the room-id to join.
2. Once the player have joined successfully, a 5x5 table with numbers 1-25 (including 1 and 25) arranged randomly will be displayed to both the players.
3. Each player, turn by turn marks a number on their board which will be reflected on the opponents board as well.
4. Whenever a **row** or a **column** or a **diagonal** in the table is completely marked, the player will earn one point.
5. When a player have scored 5 or more than five, a **Bingo Button** will appear on that players screen.
6. The first player to press the Bingo button will win. If both players press at the same time, then the game will be a draw.
7. Thats it! Happy Bingo.
